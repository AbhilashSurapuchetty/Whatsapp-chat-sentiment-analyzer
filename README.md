# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

## Project Description
This project is a Sentiment Analysis web application that classifies social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled social media posts and utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data and extract features. The classification model is implemented using a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

## Features
- Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing the text data.
- Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
- Model Training: Training a classification model to predict sentiment.
- Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface to input text and analyze sentiment.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.
